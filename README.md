# MicroBlog

Flask is very popular framework for web developemnt in Python. Although, it is not suited for very large applications but still it can scale well upto a level. Flask gives you enough flexibility for creating web-apis.

The code in this repository shows how to create a small micro-blog using flask. In order to get the code running you need to have the following things installed:
* Python 3.4.xx (or higher version)
* Flask
* Jinja
* A database of your choice (though syntax for database operations will change according the type of database used)

`run.py` is used for running up the server.
